bacula-scripts
==============

Simple scripts that may be used on bacula clients. Currently provided are
scripts for doing LVM snapshots. Tested on Debian 7.6, lvm2. 

How to
------

Download the scripts, for example::

    cd /tmp/
    wget https://github.com/ptomulik/bacula-scripts/archive/master.zip
    unzip master.zip

Copy the content of ``scripts/`` into ``/usr/local/bin/``::

    cp /tmp/bacula-resubmit-master/scripts/* /usr/local/bin/

Based on the ``*.example`` scripts, create your own scripts (without
``.example`` suffix)::

    cp /usr/local/bin/bacu_services.example /usr/local/bin/bacu_services
    vim /usr/local/bin/bacu_services  # customize the list of services
    cp /usr/local/bin/bacu_before_backup.example /usr/local/bin/bacu_before_backup
    vim /usr/local/bin/bacu_before_backup # customize the list of LVM snapshots
    cp /usr/local/bin/bacu_after_backup.example /usr/local/bin/bacu_after_backup
    vim /usr/local/bin/bacu_before_backup # customize the list of LVM snapshots

You'll find more details in the ``*.example`` scripts.
